# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Engine
Goal of this project is to predict values of the two output variables 'GT Compressor decay state coefficient' and 'GT turbine decay state coefficient' based on the values of 16 features representing meassurements in the vessel and specifically the engine compartment. Algorithms applied were linear regression and descision tree regressor.
